title: "Google Timeline: The Big Brother of Your Transport Emissions"

---

A few weeks ago I came across this image and found the message striking. I've
followed a vegan diet for the past 5 years, and try my best to take the train when travelling across europe, so
I have some awareness of these impacts. Even so, the magnitude was surprising.

I wanted to see how much of my own transport emissions were coming from flights,
and how that stacks up against the average person. 

Being a lazy programmer, I decided to try and use Google Timeline data to get
this rather than manually entering all my flights for the last `n` years. If
you are have Google Timeline enabled in the Google Maps app, you can download
your data from [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout).
You can take a look at own emissions by visiting the app I created to
visualize this data: [https://transport-co2-emissions.streamlit.app/](https://transport-co2-emissions.streamlit.app/)

The results for me personally? It's not a pretty picture. In 2017, the worst
year I have data for, I took 13 flights

For starters, flying is distributed highly non-uniformly across the global 
population. An often quoted statistic is that 1% of the world's population
accounts for 50% of all flights. 

More worryingly, the path towards decarbonization for aviation is unclear. 
In general, airlines seem to be relying on a combination of sustainable
aviation fuel (SAFs) and carbon offsets to reach net zero. Just a week ago 
the Royal Society published a report into the viability of SAFs in covering the 
current level of flying in the UK aviation industry, with two main conclusions:
1) To use biofuels, half of all agricultural land in UK would need to be repurposed
2) To use hydrogen, double the current renewable energy production level would
   be needed

This becomes even more challenging when you consider the increased
demand on the electricity grid from personal vehicle and home heating
electrification, which in the UK is projected to contribute to a 15%
increase in demand by 2035.

As it stands, the continuing 


Since diving into these numbers, I decided to take Flight Free UK's 
challenge of a flight free year for 2023.
